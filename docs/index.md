## Spatial Predictions for Topology-Aware IoT Applications

### Overview
The goal of the project is to undergo spatial inference for topology-aware IoT applicaitions in which the sensor locations are themselves variable. In most IoT applications for spatial inference typically topology-aware applications have static locations the goal is to develop an approach wherein the sensors can change locations. To this end I will use a spatio-temporal graphical neural network (with knowledge of the sensor topology) to make spatio-temporal locations. The main goal is to have spatially correct predictions at some time `t` (and maybe `t+1`). My initial case study will be a traffic estimation wherein the measurment sensors can move locations. I will synthetically generate data using an open source traffic software.
